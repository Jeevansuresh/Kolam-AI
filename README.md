This project is a work-in-progress prototype of Zenyxa, an AI-powered virtual front desk assistant designed to automate guest communication, booking, support, backend operations, and business analytics for hotels and service apartments.

We are currently developing this solution specifically for a real-world test case at Kolam Apartments, a serviced apartment in Chennai. This live prototype will help us validate features, performance, and scalability.

Once the core framework is stable and tested, Zenyxa will be available as a plug-and-play solution for other hospitality businesses seeking smart automation, improved guest experience, and operational efficiency.

Stay tuned for updates. We are actively building!
